# Lab 0: Prerequisites

## Install Docker

Before you start running any of the exercises, make sure you have downloaded Docker CE from the [Docker store](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community).

*Note:* you will be prompted to create an account on the Docker store if you don't already have one.

Once you have installed Docker, you will need to ensure that you [switch to Linux Containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).
