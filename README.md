# Java Containers 101

Welcome to the Java containers 101 workshop!

## Labs

Now that you have a bit more understanding around the challenges of running Java in containers, let's get stuck right in with the labs! Before we get started on the labs be sure to run [Lab 0](./labs/Lab_0.md) to install the prereqs. Although there are no dependencies between labs, you should attempt to run through each one and the content chronologically as the lab works through concept chronologically:

1. [Lab 0: Prerequisites](./labs/Lab_0.md)
2. [Lab 1: Choosing the right base image](./labs/Lab_1.md)
3. [Lab 2: Fine-tuning Java applications pt1](./labs/Lab_2.md)
4. [Lab 3: Fine-tuning Java applications pt2](./labs/Lab_3.md)
5. [Lab 4: Setting container resource constraints](./labs/Lab_4.md)
