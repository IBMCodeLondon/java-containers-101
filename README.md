# Java Containers 101

Welcome to the Java containers 101 workshop!

## Labs

Now that you have a bit more understanding around the challenges of running Java in containers, let's get stuck right in with the labs! Before we get started on the labs be sure to run [Lab 0](./labs/lab_0) to install the prereqs. Other than [Lab 0](./labs/lab_0) each lab is a stand-alone lab and can be run in any order. 

1. [Lab 0: Pre-requisites](./labs/lab_0)
2. [Lab 1: Choosing the right base image](./labs/lab_1)
3. [Lab 2: ](./labs/lab_2)
4. [Lab 3](./labs/lab_3)
